# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

We will be analysing a block of ride-share data into a visually appealing line graph to summarizes how the data varies based on 
city type and discuss how those differences could impact decision made within the company.  Attracting riders and drivers requires that volume expectations are met.  We will do a deep dive to see how the geographical location affect the potential revenue to be captured by PyBer.

## Results

The result from the data analysis help us identify the most lucrative areas to operate with the high driver counts.  These areas would be the most useful to market to and provide infrastructure for in order to capitalize on the market opportunity.

The urban locations had a significantly greater number of total fares, resulting in 62.7% of the total volume experienced by PyBer between January and the end of April in 2019.  In order to attract and maintain a regular driving workforce, having enough volume to support individuals making the commitment to work for PyBer is essential.  Witht this in mind, if the company was to market to rural areas the revenue generated per ride is greater. This could be a point to consider with expanding the business.

The rural locations had a higher average ride cost, however the increase in per ride revenue was not significant enough to compete with the volume experienced in larger centers.  The average fare per driver in rural areas is notably higher which could be a good incentive, providing the number of drivers do not outweight the demand required in these areas.

## Summary

In sumation, the areas with greater demand require more drivers to maintain viability.  
- For rural and suburban areas the average fare per trip is much greater so there is value to servicing these areas.  
- Ensuring that the driver count matches the demand for rides is essential to maintaining profitability.  
- Maintaining supply equilibrium makes the lower volume areas economically viable and would enable PyBer to become a household name across the country.

Taking these factors into consideration can help propel PyBer to be everyone number one choice when looking for economical and efficient transportation options.
